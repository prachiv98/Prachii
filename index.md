## HELLO

If it’s your first time around here then HEY.  My name’s Prachi and I’m a twenty-three year old content creator living in Chandigarh. After studying Commerce for five years I decided it was time to go full time with my love for all things online.

I’m so excited to bring all kinds of content to the table. Whether it’s where to find the perfect date night recipe, which hair masks ACTUALLY work or simply where the hell to find the perfect midi skirt that’s not too long … but not too short. Ya get where I’m going with this… from travel to food, to personal AF entries I wanna chat about it allll and I’d LOVE for you to join me along the way.
